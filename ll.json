The questions should be prioritized to ensure a structured approach, focusing specifically on branding perspectives that the product manager must answer.\n\n### Key Branding Questions to Consider\n\n1. **Target Audience**:\n   - Who is our primary target audience for the PowerPoint add-in?\n   - What are their needs, pain points, and preferences when it comes to PowerPoint solutions?\n\n2. **Brand Identity**:\n   - How does this add-in align with PrezLab\u2019s overall brand identity and values?\n   - Should the add-in adopt its own distinct branding, or should it closely follow the existing PrezLab branding guidelines?\n\n3. **Market Positioning**:\n   - What is our unique value proposition for this add-in compared to competitors in the marketplace?\n   - What positioning do we want to establish: premium, budget-friendly, or feature-rich?\n\n4. **Product Features**:\n   - Which features of the add-in are most appealing to our target audience?\n   - How should we communicate these features in branding elements such as the logo, tagline, and promotional materials?\n\n5. **Pricing Strategy**:\n   - How will our branding influence the pricing strategy of the add-in? Should we position it as a premium offering?\n   - What pricing models will resonate with our target audience?\n\n6. **Marketing Channels**:\n   - Which marketing channels should we prioritize to effectively reach our target audience?\n   - How can our branding be adapted for different marketing platforms (website, social media, newsletters)?\n\n7. **Brand Experience**:\n   - What experience do we want users to have when interacting with our brand through the add-in?\n   - How can we ensure a consistent brand experience across all touchpoints?\n\n8. **Differentiation**:\n   - What specific elements will differentiate our add-in from others in the market?\n   - Can we create memorable branding elements that emphasize this differentiation?\n\n9. **Feedback and Iteration**:\n   - How will we gather feedback on the branding of the add-in from our target audience?\n   - What metrics will be used to measure the success of our branding efforts?\n\n### Output Format\n\nThe output should be clearly formatted as a numbered list of questions, maintaining structured categories for easy reference, and should emphasize a branding perspective. Each question should be thorough enough to prompt comprehensive answers from the product manager.",

The API must be capable of parsing the CSV file, validating its contents, and inserting the products into a database. Follow these instructions closely:\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Define the Standard for the CSV File:**  \n   - Determine the required columns (e.g., `ProductID`, `ProductName`, `Price`, `Quantity`, etc.).  \n   - Specify data types for each column (e.g., `ProductID` as integer, `Price` as float).\n   - Outline any constraints (like required fields, maximum lengths, etc.).  \n\n2. **Endpoint Creation:**\n   - **POST /api/products/upload**:  \n     - Description: Uploads a CSV file containing product details.  \n     - Request:\n       - Headers: `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`\n       - Body: Form data containing the CSV file.\n\n     - Response:\n       - Success (200 OK): JSON with a message confirming the upload and the number of products processed.  \n       - Failure (400 Bad Request): JSON with error messages specifying validation failures.\n\n3. **CSV Parsing:**  \n   - Use a library (e.g., `Pandas` for Python or built-in libraries for Node.js) to read the CSV format.  \n   - Ensure that all required fields are present and type-correct.\n\n4. **Validation Rules:**\n   - Validate each record against the predefined standard.  \n   - Check for missing fields, incorrect types, and range limits.  \n   - Create a comprehensive list of error messages for failed validations to return in the response.\n\n5. **Database Insertion:**\n   - Use an ORM (like SQLAlchemy for Python, Sequelize for Node.js) to insert valid products into the database.  \n   - Handle any potential database errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses.\n\n6. **Return Response:**  \n   - After processing, provide a summary in the response:\n     - Total records processed.\n     - Number of records successfully added.\n     - Detailed errors for failed validations (if any).\n\n### Output Format\n- The API should return JSON responses in the following format:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"message\": \"Upload successful\",\n     \"totalProcessed\": 100,\n     \"successCount\": 98,\n     \"errors\": [\n       {\n         \"row\": 5,\n         \"error\": \"Invalid price format\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```  \n\n### Notes\n- Handle edge cases where the CSV is empty.\n- Ensure the API can handle concurrent uploads without data collision issues.\n- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse.  \n- Include appropriate security measures for file uploads to prevent malicious files from being processed.",

        "prompt_text": "Create a product management feature for an e-commerce website using separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets. The JavaScript code should be placed inside a `js` folder alongside a `products.json` file that stores the product data. The feature must be able to dynamically fetch, display, and update product information including title, description, and five images, based on the contents of `products.json`.\n\nThe JavaScript should:\n- Load product data dynamically from the `products.json` file in the same `js` folder.\n- Allow modification of product title and description.\n- Scrape and replace exactly five product image URLs from a given Amazon product URL.\n- Ensure that any additions or updates to products reflect directly and persist within the `products.json` file.\n\nRequirements:\n- Provide **three separate code snippets** for:\n  1. HTML structure to display the products in a modern, clean layout.\n  2. CSS styles to create a modern, user-friendly product display.\n  3. JavaScript to fetch, display, and update the product data from `products.json` and handle image URL scraping and product detail updates.\n\n- The product data schema for `products.json` should follow the provided example structure including fields such as `id`, `name` (title), `features` (description in HTML), and five image URLs (`img1` to `img5`).\n\n- Changes in product data\u2014including adding products, changing titles, descriptions, or images\u2014must directly update the `products.json` file inside the `js` folder.\n\n- Use the provided Amazon product URL and image URL examples as references for scraping and replacing images.\n\n- The solution must outline an approach for scraping image URLs from Amazon product pages programmatically within the JavaScript code (for example, via fetch requests or APIs), ensuring it replaces the five image URLs in the product data accordingly.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. **HTML:** Create a semantic product display container and placeholders for product title, images, and description.\n2. **CSS:** Style the product container for a modern and clean web look suitable for e-commerce.\n3. **JavaScript:**\n   - Fetch the `products.json` file asynchronously from the `js` folder.\n   - Parse and display the product title, images, and description dynamically in the HTML.\n   - Provide functions to update the product title and description.\n   - Implement functionality to scrape 5 main product image URLs from a given Amazon product URL (note any CORS restrictions and potential need for a scraping proxy).\n   - Update the `products.json` file with any new or changed product data, including new image URLs.\n   - Make sure updates to `products.json` persist and reflect on future fetches.\n\n# Output Format\n\n- Provide three distinct code blocks labeled **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.\n- Include comments in the code snippets explaining key parts.\n- Use consistent indentation and formatting for readability.\n\n# Examples\n\n```html\n<!-- HTML snippet to display products dynamically -->\n<div id=\"product-list\"></div>\n```\n\n```css\n/* CSS snippet for a modern product card layout */\n.product-card { ... }\n```\n\n```js\n// JavaScript snippet to fetch, display, update products from products.json\n// and scrape 5 image URLs from Amazon\nasync function fetchProducts() { ... }\n```\n\n# Notes\n\n- Directly modifying `products.json` via client-side JavaScript is not usually possible due to browser security restrictions. Assume an environment where the JavaScript code has permission to read and write files in the `js` folder (e.g., via Node.js backend or local development environment).\n- If implementing a fully client-side solution is required, clearly mention the limitation that direct file writing is not possible without a backend.\n- For scraping Amazon images, anticipate potential obstacles such as CORS and legal limitations. Recommend a backend scraping approach or API.\n\nThis prompt ensures you provide clear, modular, and maintainable front-end code that interacts with product data stored in `products.json`, supports dynamic updates, and maintains a modern website aesthetic.",

Include a detailed analysis of existing metrics, propose alternative or additional metrics that could enhance the assessment, and explain the importance of each suggested metric. Consider how each metric aligns with the user goals for both riders and drivers, ensuring to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and possible obstacles to achieving them. \n\n### Current Metrics Overview\n1. **Acquisition Metric**  \n   a. Number of riders who click on search / Number of riders who open the app\n\n2. **Activation Metrics**  \n   a. Number of riders who started their first ride / Number of riders who booked their first ride  \n   b. Number of drivers who reached the pickup location for their first ride\n\n3. **Engagement Metrics**  \n   a. Average number of rides booked by a rider in a week/month  \n   b. Average number of rides completed by a driver in a day/week/month\n\n4. **Accuracy Metrics**  \n   a. Number of rides where the location shown on the map matches the address entered / Number of locations searched  \n   b. Number of rides where the driver reached the correct pickup or drop-off location.\n\n5. **Health Metrics**  \n   a. Latency between searching an address and the display of maps  \n   b. Loading time of maps during the ride.\n\n### Suggested Improvements  \n1. **Acquisition Metric Enhancement**  \n   - Consider tracking the rate of new riders and drivers who engage with the map after their first ride for deeper insight into user retention. \n\n2. **Activation Metric Refinement**  \n   - Introduce user feedback surveys post-first ride to gauge satisfaction levels and reasons for disengagement if applicable.\n\n3. **Engagement Metrics Addition**  \n   - Metric for tracking user sessions on the map feature; assess how frequently riders and drivers interact with the map throughout their usage journey.\n\n4. **Accuracy Metrics Expansion**  \n   - Incorporate user-reported inaccuracies of locations alongside automated verification to obtain qualitative feedback. \n\n5. **Health Metrics Extra Focus**  \n   - Measure response time of the map's search function as riders input their addresses, alongside the current loading time evaluations. \n\n### Conclusion\nExplain the potential impact of these improved metrics on Uber's operations, user satisfaction, and overall market competitiveness. Illustrate how each proposed measure could help clarify upward trends or areas needing immediate attention.",

The current system uploads product images directly into MongoDB, accepts product categories, allows product deletion, and has dashboard filters, but has several issues.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1. Modify the image upload process so that instead of saving images into MongoDB, the images are uploaded to Cloudinary. Make sure the system uses the existing Cloudinary integration. After uploading an image to Cloudinary, only store the resulting Cloudinary file URL in MongoDB.\n\n2. When adding a new product, allow the user to select a category or create a new category if it doesn\u2019t already exist. For new categories, create a matching folder in Cloudinary if it doesn't exist, upload the product's image file to that folder, and save the new category\u2019s ID with the product in the MongoDB collection. Ensure this new category creation seamlessly integrates with the current product creation workflow without breaking the existing category-to-product mappings.\n\n3. Fix the product deletion functionality which currently throws an error: \"product.remove is not a function\". Ensure the product removal is correctly implemented using current Mongoose or MongoDB methods.\n\n4. Fix the filters on the dashboard so that they properly work with the backend, enabling effective product filtering based on chosen criteria.\n\nSteps to accomplish:\n- Confirm Cloudinary integration is set up.\n- Update the image upload function to upload images to Cloudinary and save URLs to MongoDB.\n- Implement logic to check if a category exists; if not, create a new category and corresponding Cloudinary folder.\n- Link the product to the category by storing the category ID correctly.\n- Adjust deletion code to use the correct method for removing a product document.\n- Debug and update backend filter handling to make dashboard filters functional.\n\nBe sure to follow best practices for asynchronous operations and error handling throughout.\n\nOutput Format:\nProvide a detailed explanation of the changes to be applied to the codebase, specifying which files or modules to modify. Include code snippets illustrating the fixed or added code segments showing the corrected upload, category creation, deletion, and filter implementations. Clearly explain how each change solves the corresponding issue listed above.\n\nExamples:\n- Show how to upload an image to Cloudinary and save its URL to MongoDB.\n- Show how to check and create a category with a Cloudinary folder, then link it to a product.\n- Show the corrected product deletion method usage.\n- Show the backend logic for handling product filters correctly.\n\nNotes:\n- Preserve existing workflows and ensure backward compatibility where possible.\n- Consider any necessary updates to schema models if required.\n- Indicate how to test each fix to verify correct behavior.\n\nYour final response should be a comprehensive developer guide covering all requested changes.",

Additionally, for each unique insight, provide a summary of 50 to 100 words that elaborates on the user's concern or experience.\n\n### **Steps to Process Tickets:**  \n1. **Understand the Ticket Thoroughly:**  \n   - Read the entire support ticket carefully to comprehend user concerns, pain points, feedback, and expectations.  \n   - Extract key points directly from the ticket without making assumptions or rephrasing.  \n\n2. **Generate Unique Insights:**  \n   - Identify genuine, unique insights that provide real user experiences and align with product management priorities.  \n   - Avoid generic or vague feedback, and focus on unique pain points or issues.  \n   - Avoid redundancy; ensure each insight is unique and not just a reworded repetition of common issues.  \n   - Filter out insights that are previously addressed in existing use cases or known pain points to concentrate on new, actionable findings significant for product strategy.  \n   - **Special Priority for Integration Requests:**  \n     - Always break down multiple integration requests into separate insights, each formatted individually.  \n     - Ensure each integration request is distinctly recorded as an independent product request.  \n   - **Check for Uniqueness:**  \n     - Before adding a new insight to the list, compare it with existing insights to ensure it is not a duplicate.  \n     - Use a hash or a unique identifier for each insight to facilitate quick checks.\n\n3. **Extract Relevant Tags for Categorization:**  \n   - Identify core themes, affected features, and impact areas (e.g., \"User Interface Bug,\" \"Feature Request for Customization\").  \n   - Capture relevant error messages, module names, user actions, and crucial phrases that help categorize the insights effectively.  \n   - Ensure tags are broad enough for effective filtering while remaining specific to the insights generated.\n\n### **Desired Data Format:**  \n[\n  {\n  \"name\": \"Unique Insight\",\n  \"summary\": \"50 to 100 word summary elaborating on the insight.\",\n  \"tags\": [\"Generic tags representing the core issues identified in the insight\"]\n  }\n]\n\n### **Example Data Format:**  \n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Gist of the unique insight from a Product Manager's perspective in 8 to 15 words.\",\n    \"summary\": \"A brief description of the user's concern or experience elaborating on the insight in 50 to 100 words.\",\n    \"tags\": [\"Major issue identified\", \"Feature/module impacted\", \"Associated error messages (if any)\", \"Critical user interactions\", \"Overall impact on customer satisfaction\"]\n  }\n]\n\n### **Enforcement Mechanisms**  \n- **Duplicate Check**: If a ticket contains \"I can't log in via Google\" and \"Google login broken\", output **ONE insight**: \"Google OAuth login fails with 500 errors\" including a summary of the issue.  \n- **Format Validation**: Reject any non-JSON responses.",

Respond to each user prompt carefully to assist with the requested action.\n\nFor adding new products, prompt the user step-by-step to collect: product name, unique SKU, category, stock quantity, reorder point, cost per unit, selling price per unit, and optionally an image. Validate that numeric inputs are logical (e.g., quantities and prices are non-negative).\n\nWhen updating existing products, ask for the product name, the field to update (choose from Name, SKU, Category, Quantity, Reorder Point, Cost, Price), then request the new value. Confirm the update with the user.\n\nFor viewing inventory, offer options such as showing all products, low-stock products, searching by name or SKU, and generating reports on inventory value or products below reorder thresholds.\n\nWhen adjusting stock, ask for product identification (name or SKU), adjustment type (Increase or Decrease), quantity, and any notes. Ensure stock quantities cannot go negative after adjustments.\n\nProvide general prompts to guide the user on next steps or offer help as needed.\n\nMaintain clarity and confirm critical actions to avoid errors. Guide the user through each step interactively and validate inputs for consistency.\n\n# Steps\n- Identify user intent (add, update, view, adjust, or general help).\n- Collect required information with clear prompts.\n- Validate inputs (e.g., numeric checks, SKU uniqueness where applicable).\n- Provide confirmations or summaries of changes.\n- Offer reports or search as requested.\n\n# Output Format\nUse clear, conversational language in responses suitable for interactive dialogue. Format reports as bullet lists or tables if needed, using plain text or markdown for readability.\n\n# Examples\n- Adding product: \"Please enter the name of the new product.\" -> \"Enter SKU:\" -> \"Enter category:\" ... -> \"Would you like to add an image for this product? (Yes/No)\"\n- Updating product: \"Enter product name to update.\" -> \"Which field would you like to modify?\" -> \"Enter the new value.\" -> \"Product updated successfully.\"\n- Viewing inventory: \"Showing products with low stock (<= reorder point):\" followed by list.\n- Adjusting stock: \"Enter product name or SKU.\" -> \"Adjustment type (Increase/Decrease):\" -> \"Quantity:\" -> \"Notes:\" -> \"Stock adjusted successfully.\"\n\n# Notes\n- Always confirm with user before finalizing updates or significant changes.\n- Handle invalid inputs by prompting the user again politely.\n- Support both product name and SKU when identifying products.\n- For reports, include totals or counts as relevant.\n\n",

The plan is to build an online self-service product enabling customers to choose coverage options and purchase insurance without needing a representative. The success of this product depends not just on the delivered features but also on factors like business promotion and pricing strategy.\n\nYour task is to outline what organizational, planning, and measurement changes are needed to transition from feature-focused quarterly goals to true outcome-based goals. Consider changes in goal setting, team alignment, metrics, collaboration with business units, and feedback loops.\n\n# Steps\n\n- Explain the limitations of feature-based goal setting and why shifting to outcome focus matters.\n- Describe how to define clear, measurable business outcomes aligned with company strategy.\n- Discuss how goals should integrate inputs and dependencies beyond IT, like business promotion and pricing.\n- Recommend adjustments in planning cycles and stakeholder collaboration to support outcome ownership.\n- Propose new measurement methods and KPIs to track progress towards desired outcomes rather than output.\n- Suggest processes for continuous validation, learning, and adaptation based on outcome metrics.\n\n# Output Format\n\nRespond with a detailed, structured explanation in prose covering necessary changes to transition to outcome-based goals, organized by the key aspects above.

        "prompt_text": "You are tasked with developing and integrating a product management feature with backend support, fulfilling the following requirements:\n\n1. **Category Selection:** Implement a 'Category' field for products as a dropdown menu on the frontend. The dropdown values must be hardcoded and managed solely in the backend.\n\n2. **IPC Generation:** The system must automatically generate an IPC identifier in chronological order on the backend for each product. Additionally, this IPC should be editable from the frontend interface.\n\n3. **Backend Integration:** Fully integrate all product service operations with the backend, including create, edit, delete, and retrieve functionalities. Ensure synchronization between frontend actions and backend processes.\n\n# Steps\n\n- Define the hardcoded category values in the backend.\n- Expose an endpoint to retrieve categories for populating the dropdown.\n- Implement automatic chronological IPC generation logic in the backend.\n- Provide an endpoint to edit the IPC from the frontend.\n- Implement create, edit, delete, and get endpoints for products.\n- Connect the frontend to these endpoints to manage product operations seamlessly.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide detailed backend API specifications, including endpoint URLs, HTTP methods, expected request/response body formats, and error handling strategies. Additionally, provide frontend interface behavior descriptions for the dropdown and IPC editing functionality, including validation rules and user interaction flows.\n\n# Notes\n\n- Ensure IPC uniqueness and chronological order integrity.\n- Keep category values immutable on the frontend, controlled exclusively by the backend.\n- The IPC editing interface should validate inputs to maintain format consistency and chronological relevance.\n- Consider security implications for editable IPC fields.\n\nFocus on clear, comprehensive instructions to guide development and integration efforts effectively.",

For example, if a box of 50 connectors is purchased, the stock for that serial number should be recorded as 50.\n   - When items are issued, the remaining stock should deduct accordingly. For example, if 5 connectors are issued, the stock should now reflect 45 remaining.\n   - Options for serial number and model should be made optional.\n\n2. **Issuing Products**:\n   - When issuing a product, include a dropdown to select the product type (Consumable or Fixed).\n   - Upon selecting the product type, display the available quantities, name, product code, etc., for the selected product type, similar to the existing implementation for issuing products.\n\n3. **Database Analysis and Implementation**:\n   - Analyze the existing database schema to accommodate the new Consumable Assets structure and ensure proper stock tracking.\n   - Modify or extend the database tables as necessary for effective management of both product types.\n\nMake sure that the user experience for adding and issuing products remains consistent, with clear instructions and information displayed during the process.",

This system includes: 1) an IVR call component that interacts with candidates, collects their responses via audio recordings, and logs the information into a Google Sheet; 2) a business logic filter that matches candidate data against job descriptions; 3) a callback mechanism that redials candidates after a set time if calls are unanswered, eventually resorting to emails after multiple attempts; 4) appointment scheduling functionality to set up interviews via Meet/Zoom with company representatives; and 5) video capture of candidates along with their answers to generate detailed reports evaluating question performance.\n\nGiven this product concept, provide the next five concrete and prioritized implementation steps needed to launch this product to market. Consider technical feasibility, user experience, integration challenges, and potential risks. Justify why these steps are critical and their impact on the overall product readiness.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Design and prototype the IVR system capable of conducting interactive calls, recording candidate audio, and exporting data securely to Google Sheets.\n2. Develop and validate the business logic algorithm for parsing candidate data and accurately matching candidates to job descriptions.\n3. Implement the robust call retry and email follow-up mechanism with configurable timings and retry counts.\n4. Integrate calendar APIs to enable automated appointment scheduling with company interviewers on Meet/Zoom platforms.\n5. Build and test the video capture module that records candidate responses and produces an evaluative report on their answers.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide a numbered list with each step titled clearly, followed by a detailed explanation including rationale, key challenges, and success metrics for each step.\n\n# Notes\n\nKeep the focus on actionable development priorities that balance MVP delivery and scalable architecture. Address data privacy and compliance considerations where relevant.",
